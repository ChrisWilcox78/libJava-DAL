Changes in 5.0.0

Moved Pair and StringInputStreaam to com.diversityarrays.dalclient.util
so that they don't conflict with other android development libraries.

Added wantEmptyRecords to DalResponse with getter/setter to support some
server code in a customer that insisted on returning empty data records.
This change makes DalResponse.visitResults() call the DalResponseRecordVisitor
with the empty records if the value is set to true.

A null or empty filterClause parameter to CommandBuilder.setFilterClause(...)
removes the extant filtering clause from the command being constructed.

Introduce OperationKeyword and addKeywordClause() and addKeywordClauses(...)
methods to CommandBuilder/QueryBuilder

Introduce UpdateBuilder as an extension of PostBuilder.

Note that we are still using the collections-generic library and not
Java8's java.util.function package because those are not supported on
the Android platform and this library needs to be available there.
